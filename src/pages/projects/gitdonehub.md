description: 'I am working on this project in my free time while on the job search.
    The stack as of now is: Go + Go Fiber + Go Templ + PostGreSQL + Redis + Websockets + HTMX + Tailwind CSS.
    I love using the Kanban approach to task management in projects, but I find that most existing solutions
    have a bloated UI and are insufficiently fast.'
