                I am an experienced software engineer and US-based Computer Science graduate (currently in the Tampa Bay area). I have been a full-stack developer for over 6 years now,
                and have had experience with a multitude of programming languages and tech stacks.

      My real-world experience in software development began in 2017 with PHP, first building completely custom themes for WordPress websites, and later
      developing custom web applications using Laravel. I have since worked on projects in Python (Django/Flask/FastAPI), JavaScript (Node.js), and Golang (stdlib/Fiber/Echo), among others.
      On the frontend, I have worked with React, Svelte, and Astro, and have recently been exploring the hypermedia approach with HTMX.

        Two years ago, I made the decision to return to college and complete the final 3 semesters of my Computer Science degree, which I have done (with honors).
        I am a quick study and a clear and efficient communicator. I have experience with leading a team of developers and delivering projects on time.
